                    <li>The 0.45 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 4.5%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with moderate-to-good efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive and relatively strong (in the upper half of the moderate range).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI with good efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce meaningful growth.</li>
                    <li>The moderate-high elasticity suggests that the Qatar market is quite responsive to media campaigns, making it a good candidate for increased media investment.</li>
                    <li>This responsiveness suggests that the planned 86.93% increase in media impressions for 2025 should drive significant growth in travel queries.</li>

                <p>If you're planning to increase media impressions by 86.93% for 2025 (as currently planned), you can expect approximately a 39.1% increase in travel queries (86.93% × 0.45 = 39.1%).

                <h5>How It's Calculated:</h5>
                <p>Based on survey responses to questions like "What are the main reasons you would not consider traveling to Abu Dhabi?" The percentages represent the proportion of respondents who selected each reason.</p>

                <h5>Current Barriers (Q4 2024 vs Q4 2023):</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Direct Flights</strong>: 41% (+8pp) cite lack of direct flights</li>
                    <li><strong>Value for Money</strong>: 33% (-1pp) say it's not value for money</li>
                    <li><strong>Only for Younger People</strong>: 22% (0pp) think it's only for younger people</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance Perception</strong>: 21% (+19pp) say it's too far to travel</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Much to Do</strong>: 20% (-2pp) feel there's not much to do there</li>

                <h5>Business Implications:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Direct Flights (41%, +8pp)</strong>: This significant increase indicates growing frustration with flight connectivity. Marketing should work with airlines to increase direct flight options and highlight existing connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value for Money (33%, -1pp)</strong>: While slightly improving, this remains a significant barrier. Marketing should emphasize the value proposition of Abu Dhabi experiences and develop special value packages for the Qatar market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Only for Younger People (22%, 0pp)</strong>: This perception has remained stable. Marketing should showcase experiences that appeal to all age groups and highlight family-friendly activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance Perception (21%, +19pp)</strong>: This dramatic increase is concerning, especially given the close proximity of Qatar to Abu Dhabi. Marketing should emphasize the short flight time (under 1 hour) and ease of travel between the two destinations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Much to Do (20%, -2pp)</strong>: This slight improvement suggests that awareness of Abu Dhabi's attractions is growing, but more work is needed to showcase the diversity of experiences available.</li>

                <h5>Strategic Recommendation:</h5>
                <p>Based on these barriers, a "Quick Weekend Escape" campaign highlighting the short travel time, direct flight options, and value-packed 2-day itineraries would address three of the five top barriers to visitation from the Qatar market. This campaign should emphasize the diversity of experiences available for all age groups and showcase how much can be enjoyed in a short timeframe.</p>
